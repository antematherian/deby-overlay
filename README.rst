This is a rapidly changing debugging overlay. No builds are stored here for
any signifacnt amount of time, and you shouldn't rely on this overlay in any
shape or form. Its sole purpose is to test a new ebuild in a version controled
manner. If the ebuild is satisfatory, it will be moved somewhere else.

If you were referred here from `bugs.funtoo.org`_, please follow the directions on `_local_overlay_instructions`_ after cloning this repository.
